Look at the search place (its in travel_search.html).
when user searches country to travel with added pax (any) days of staying (any), budget (optional if user leaves blank means no need to use it, and if uses if user puts its currency use this currency to look), visa requirement (also optional if user leaves off dont use this).
-------------
lets assume (as user 1) we are using all these as shown in the image, than website suppose to look for the inputted country tows/cities where user can travel display top 3 towns or cities. and 2 similar countries to travel.
------------------------
the objectives ->
Use your existing search.css and style.css rules, so the page design matches your screenshots (e.g. “Maldives” and “Phuket” card designs).
Each result is displayed as a package card (image on the left, info in the middle, price/“Check” button on the right).
The result cards highlight:
Destination name (e.g. Maldives Paradise)
ChatGPT-provided description
Days of stay
Number of people (pax)
Budget (if used)
Visa requirement (if turned on)
Approximate cost (including hotels, or a dummy cost)
“Check” Button for Detail Page

Each result card has a “Check” button.
Clicking it leads to a detail page (e.g. /country/<id>/) or something similar.
That detail page shows deeper info about the place (it’s the single template for any country/city detail).
Budget & Currency Handling

The user’s profile in the database stores their default currency and (optionally) a default budget.
The search form pre-fills these fields from the user’s profile if they are logged in.
If a user overrides the currency/budget in the form, that override applies for that search only (it does not necessarily update the DB).
No “hardcoded” currency like USD everywhere; the logic always checks the user’s DB currency or the form override.
Visa Requirements

The search form shows a “Visa Feature” toggle only if the user is logged in and has a citizenship (country) set in their profile.
If they enable the visa toggle, the code calls an external API or your logic to decide if a visa is needed for the user’s passport going to that destination.
User Authentication Impacts Form

If the user is not logged in, hide the budget & visa fields (or show them as HiddenInput).
If the user is logged in, show the budget field (pre-filled with their DB value) and currency dropdown.
The same goes for the visa toggle, which only appears if the user’s profile has a stored country.
Profile Page

On the profile page, the user can set:
Their “Country Citizen” (for visa logic)
Their “Preferred Currency” (used as default in searches)
Their email, username, and password.
The changes are updated in the DB via AJAX or form posts.
Top 3~5 Suggestions

After a user searches, the system typically shows the top 3 or top 5 recommended places in “package cards.”
Optionally, at the bottom, you can have a “See More” button that leads to a dedicated page with more results or a category listing.
No Actual Transactions

No flight bookings or payments are done in this site; it’s purely an informational/dummy approach.
Hotel prices and visa data come from external or dummy APIs (like RapidAPI or ChatGPT for recommendations).
Code Splitting & Includes

You keep partial templates like travel_search.html for the search bar, search_results.html if you want, and your index.html that includes them (e.g. {% include "travel_search.html" %}).
The CSS remains in style.css and search.css, and JS in script.js, loginregister.js, etc.
No Breaking Existing Flows
Don’t break the existing login, registration, or profile logic.
The search form and result display fit around the existing code.
