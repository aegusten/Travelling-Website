üìå Next Steps for Your Travel Website
Since your feature list includes AI-powered country suggestions, itinerary planning, and budget-based recommendations, consider implementing the following:

1Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Driven Country Suggestions (Visa Rules)
Approach: Use a dataset of countries, visa requirements, and categorize them into:
No visa required
E-visa available
Visa required
Implementation:
Create a Django model for countries and visa rules.
Use AI/ML (basic decision trees or pre-trained models) to suggest based on user passport country.
Display categorized countries in the frontend.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Budget-Based Destination Recommendations
Approach: Allow users to input a budget and get country recommendations based on average travel costs.
Implementation:
Create a cost database with avg. expenses per country.
Use Django queries to filter and suggest within a budget.
3Ô∏è‚É£ User Profiles with Travel Preferences
Approach: Extend Django‚Äôs user model to store:
Preferred travel style (adventure, cultural, relaxation, etc.)
Dietary needs (vegetarian, halal, etc.)
Implementation:
Extend Django‚Äôs AbstractUser model.
Create profile update views/forms.
Add "Book Now" button to UI.
üìå Your Next Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Fix the Docker issue by updating Dockerfile & .dockerignore.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure core features work (user auth, visa rules, budgets).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Start adding AI-powered suggestions for a smarter experience.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Enhance UI with templates like Tourly for a professional look.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Test in a local Docker container before scaling further.


docker exec -it fyp-web  bash  


docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up --build


docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations core
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate

-- Create a backup in Docker 
docker exec -t fyp-db pg_dump -U postgres -F c -d your_database_name -f /backups/dump-travel-202503190535.sql.gz

- To save this backup on your local machine, copy it from the container

docker cp fyp-db:/backups/dump-travel-202503190535.sql.gz .
