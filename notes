üìå Next Steps for Your Travel Website
Since your feature list includes AI-powered country suggestions, itinerary planning, and budget-based recommendations, consider implementing the following:

1Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Driven Country Suggestions (Visa Rules)
Approach: Use a dataset of countries, visa requirements, and categorize them into:
No visa required
E-visa available
Visa required
Implementation:
Create a Django model for countries and visa rules.
Use AI/ML (basic decision trees or pre-trained models) to suggest based on user passport country.
Display categorized countries in the frontend.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Budget-Based Destination Recommendations
Approach: Allow users to input a budget and get country recommendations based on average travel costs.
Implementation:
Create a cost database with avg. expenses per country.
Use Django queries to filter and suggest within a budget.
3Ô∏è‚É£ User Profiles with Travel Preferences
Approach: Extend Django‚Äôs user model to store:
Preferred travel style (adventure, cultural, relaxation, etc.)
Dietary needs (vegetarian, halal, etc.)
Implementation:
Extend Django‚Äôs AbstractUser model.
Create profile update views/forms.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Travel Itineraries & Calendar
Approach: Allow users to create trip plans.
Implementation:
Create an Itinerary model (destinations, dates, activities).
Use FullCalendar.js for UI.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Reviews & Ratings
Approach: Users can rate destinations & packages.
Implementation:
Create a Review model linked to CustomUser & Country.
Use AJAX-based star ratings.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Simplified Booking System

Create a Booking model (user, package, status).
Add "Book Now" button to UI.
